# Elo Merchant Category Recommendation

## Abstract
In this project, we will focus on resolving the problem in the Kaggle challenge named [Elo Merchant Category Recommendation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation). We will analyze, process data, and use machine learning to improve the understanding of customer loyalty for the Elo payment brand. The results show that LightGBM is the best performing algorithm on the given dataset. 

## Introduction
Elo is one of the biggest and most reliable payment brands in Brazil. "Elo Merchant Category Recommendation" problem talks about the loyalty score of credit cards for their users in the Elo brand. The loyalty score is calculated in 2 months after the historical and evaluation period. This is a regression task and we use RMSE for evaluation. In this project, we aimed to:
+ Analyze, process data to generate many suitable features from our dataset.
+ Apply various machine learning models to our dataset and do the assessment on achieved results.
